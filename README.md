# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Methods

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a groundbreaking approach in AI that combines retrieval techniques with generative models. It allows for highly accurate and context-aware responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating outputs. This methodology is crucial for applications that demand up-to-date, domain-specific, or precise information. 

In this repository, I have explored RAG with three distinct implementations, each designed to enhance the performance and versatility of AI-driven solutions.

## 1. Open-Source Resources Only
This implementation focuses on leveraging open-source tools and frameworks to build a cost-effective and transparent RAG system. By utilizing resources like Hugging Face models, FAISS for vector search, and public datasets, this section demonstrates how powerful RAG solutions can be built without relying on proprietary APIs.

**Highlights:**
- Fully open-source implementation.
- Utilizes widely available pre-trained models.
- Cost-effective and accessible to all developers.

## 2. OpenAI and LangChain
In this section, I combined OpenAI's advanced generative capabilities with LangChain's powerful orchestration tools. This hybrid approach enhances retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding, making it ideal for scenarios requiring both precision and scalability.

**Highlights:**
- Seamless integration of OpenAI models with LangChain.
- Improved performance due to the synergy of retrieval and generation.
- Tailored for professional applications needing high accuracy.

## 3. Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG represents the next step in enhancing RAG systems. By incorporating agent-based architectures, this implementation adds adaptability and improved performance. Agents dynamically manage retrieval, reasoning, and response generation to handle complex queries more effectively.

**Highlights:**
- Autonomous agents for dynamic query handling.
- Optimized for multi-step reasoning tasks.
- Superior performance in diverse and challenging scenarios.
